## Build Bounty

This project is part of Convex.dev's first "Build Bounty" A combination of a hackathon, a bug bounty and a contest. Convex is a backend development platform with some pretty impressive features. Check them out; they have a generous free tier and an active dev community on discord. -> [Convex Website](https://www.convex.dev/)

You might also want to check out BlockNote, the block-based text editors that gives the "Notion" effect -> [BlockNote](https://www.blocknotejs.org/)

## Notice

I might change the location of this repo in the future but I will definitely build out more features that take advantage of Convex's backend (starting with chat with your documents leveraging vector search and embeddings and switching from EdgeStore to Convex file storage). I will also add instructions to allow anyone who followed Antonio's tutorial to follow this repo as well. So be sure to favorite, star or watch if you're interested.
